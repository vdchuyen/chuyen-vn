As previous post, I have __OpenWRT__ installed on my little brick ( Dir 505 A1). 
This post I want to extend the functions with this.

My current home network setup:

Fiber link to the home --> Dlink Dir 505 via ether + openwrt ---> Wireless SSID extender with Totolink N151RT
 
The more you work with __OpenWRT__, the more you find it fancy. It works more than just a router/acccess point but you can do anything with it. 

I even setup ad-blocking on this little brick to protect our home clients. I just tried two solutions and it works smooth as it would be:

1. Privoxy with transparent proxy and more block rule in user.action file.
2. Dnsmasq as [superwrt.ro](https://superwrt.ro/ad-block/) suggestion. 					
>PS: Also find [Remarkable](http://remarkableapp.net) is a wonderful markdown editor and this post is tested with this nice app.

Have a nice weekend !
